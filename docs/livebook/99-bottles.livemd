### Lyrics

> 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
> Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
> 
> 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
> Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
> 
> ...and so on...
> 
> 3 bottles of beer on the wall, 3 bottles of beer.
> Take one down and pass it around, 2 bottles of beer on the wall.
> 
> 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
> Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
> 
> 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
> Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
> 
> No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
> Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
